          <p>The highly elusive and mystical place known as Jake’s Dream Job!</p>
          <br>
          <h1>But Wait...</h1>
          <p>Before we embark on this beautiful journey together, we need to go through our checklist and make sure we’re prepared for takeoff…</p>
          <br>
          <div class="checklist">
            <h1>Takeoff Checklist</h1>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>1. Golden Rule: Do you want to hire someone who treats others the way they want to be treated?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">I have a general respect for every walk of life and treat others the way I would like to be treated first and foremost.  That means no matter who you are, I will respect what you have to say whether it be critical, praise, or anything in between.  If you believe in the golden rule like I do, I will be your best employee... er, I mean co-pilot!</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>2. Books: Do you want someone who believes in learning something new every day?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">This could be a long ride, but I like to keep my mind sharp.  I believe in learning something new every day and always strive to be the absolute best version of myself.</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>3. Food, caffeine and other energy sources: Do you want someone who is humble, hungry and driven to be the best?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">I love green tea to start off my day, but my true energy source is passion.  I can run on passion for hours, days, weeks, you name it.  Learning and doing web design (in outer space) is my passion.  I am hungry, willing and eager to continue learning how to be the best designer I can be.</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>4. Radio communications: Do you want someone with excellent communication skills?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">Major portions of my current and previous jobs involved excellent written and verbal communication skills.  That should come in handy on our journey, because communication is key in every situation.</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>5. Independence: Do you want someone who challenges the status quo?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">I am open-minded, a self-starter and I think freely.  I will respect whatever you have to say whether I agree or not.  If you know of a better way to do things, please do not hesitate to share because I will do the same for you.</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>6. Buddy: Do you want someone who truly believes that two heads are always better than one?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">It’s important that we operate using the buddy system.  We will have to depend on each other at times, because we both have our strengths and no one person can take on a journey like this alone.  In my previous experiences I have found that working in a cohesive team is always more fun and rewarding than working alone.</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>7. Camera: Do you want someone with an innate passion for all things visual and beautiful?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">Taking a camera will make sure we capture those beautiful once-in-a-lifetime moments, and believe me, I have a great sense of beauty (Ask my wife!).  I have an innate love for visual design and I know my way around Illustrator and Photoshop.  How will that benefit us in space?  I’ll let you know when we encounter dreadful space pirates.</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>8. Laptop: Do you want someone who can code their designs?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">This site is built with W3C valid HTML and CSS.  I used an Emmet plugin for Sublime Text to speed up the HTML development time, SASS and Compass to speed up CSS, jQuery to speed up Javascript, and  Foundation 5 to speed up overall development time.  I used tools like Comb CSS, Modernizr and Csscss to make my code more robust and maintainable. Finally, all site assets were minified and compressed accordingly and the site is responsive, mobile-first, (mostly) DRY and has vertical rhythm.  Thank you Treehouse!  Oh yeaaah!!</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>9. Sense of Humor: Do you want someone who does a breathtaking impersonation of Will Ferrell impersonating Harey Carey?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">It’s probably best if we try to make this journey fun.  I’ve been told I do a breathtaking impersonation of Will Ferrell impersonating Harry Caray, and also that my dance moves are like a combination between Usher and Jesus.  That should help pass the time when the journey ahead seems endless and tiresome.</p>
            <p class="checklist-item"><i class="fi-check"></i>10. Nametag: Do you want someone who knows that nametags retain their stickiness even in outer space?<span>more</span></p>
            <p class="checklist-description">In that case, I am definitely your guy because I wear name tags in space.  You never know who you’ll run into while you’re out and about!</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>If you said yes to all of the above questions, then I think we are both ready for the journey ahead.  Now, one other thing before we go…</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Jake Loves Treehouse</h1>
          <p>Dearest Treehouse, I have been using your service for over a year now and I absolutely love it.  Do you believe in love at first code challenge?  It has given me the resources to follow my dreams and helped me realize that passion in the workplace is not only real, but also a legitimately achievable goal.  Having gone through a countless number of your magnificent learning videos, I can truly say that I cannot think of a place that sounds more remarkable to work for than Treehouse.</p>
          <p>I would like to extend an offer to you allowing you to “try before you buy.”  If in general you think I would be a great fit for Treehouse but you are curious about my ability to do the job, I would highly encourage you to take a chance on me and give me an opportunity to work with you all for a period of time.  This would be free of charge meaning your standard offer of paying competitive rates for the work completed need not apply here, and I promise you will not regret it.</p>

          <img src="img/About.png" class="about-img" alt="About Me" height="132" width="132">
          <p>When I was a kid, my aunt bought me an art set and an instructional drawing book one Christmas.  The set came with a solid wood case that had my name engraved on it, and it had pastels, paints, pencils and markers including every color of the rainbow.  I would sit and draw all of my favorite cartoon characters for hours.  While still in grade school, I signed up for a cartoon illustration workshop at a local college so I could learn how to create my own illustrations.</p>
          <p>I also fell in love with technology at a very young age.  I would constantly take things apart to figure out how they worked and try to fix them if I could.  I first received my very own personal computer when my grandma was getting rid of some things around the house.  It was an old green screen Macintosh with all the floppy disk programs and games still intact. I would play what seemed like an infinite number of games on that computer for hours… especially Carmen Sandiego!</p>
          <p>Fast-forward several years and not much about me has changed...  While designing the front-end of my department’s SharePoint site, I came across Mark Boulton’s Practical Guide to Designing for the Web.  It was during this project that I discovered my passion for web design.  It is the perfect mix of technology and creativity.  The more I learn about and do web design, the more I want to continue learning about and doing web design.  It makes me feel like a kid again, and really, it makes me feel like me again seeing as I still have yet to grow up.  I am truly a kid at heart in that I have a never-ending supply of optimism, I am ever curious about learning new things, and I always like to think the best of people.</p>
          <p>I enjoy living a balanced life mixed somewhere between work, family, friends, faith and fitness.  However, I am finding that more and more of my spare time is spent working on awesome design, illustration, and front-end development projects on the side.  I also enjoy adding to my smart home and programming it to do some pretty cool things.  I look forward to one day making a living by doing my true passion.</p>
